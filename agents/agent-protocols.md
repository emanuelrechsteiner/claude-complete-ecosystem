# Agent Communication Protocols

## Overview
This document defines the communication protocols between agents to ensure seamless coordination and zero conflicts in parallel development environments.

## Core Protocol Principles

### 1. Ledger-Based Task Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: All tasks tracked in agent-specific ledgers
- **Atomic Updates**: Ledger modifications are atomic and versioned
- **Dependency Tracking**: Clear dependency chains between agent tasks
- **Status Synchronization**: Real-time status updates across all agents

### 2. Control Agent Gate System
- **Plan Approval Required**: All complex plans require >99% confidence approval
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory review checkpoints during execution
- **Escalation Triggers**: Automatic escalation for confidence drops or conflicts
- **Emergency Protocols**: Immediate pause and recovery procedures

### 3. Conflict Prevention
- **Branch Isolation**: Feature branches prevent main branch conflicts
- **File Ownership**: Temporary exclusive ownership during active development
- **Integration Windows**: Scheduled merge points to avoid conflicts
- **Dependency Validation**: Pre-execution dependency verification

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Planning Agent → Control Agent
```markdown
## Plan Submission Protocol

### 1. Strategic Plan Creation
- Complete work breakdown structure
- Agent task assignments with clear deliverables
- Dependency matrix and critical path analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 2. Control Agent Review Request
**Subject**: Strategic Plan Review - [Feature Name]
**Content**:
- Executive summary with success metrics
- Detailed task breakdown per agent
- Risk assessment with confidence level
- Timeline and resource requirements

### 3. Approval Response Expected
- **APPROVED**: Proceed with task distribution
- **REVISION REQUIRED**: Specific feedback for improvements
- **DENIED**: Critical issues requiring replanning
```

### Control Agent → Specialized Agents
```markdown
## Task Authorization Protocol

### 1. Pre-Task Validation
- Architecture compliance verification
- Security requirements confirmation
- Testing standards validation
- Integration point verification

### 2. Quality Gate Schedule
- **Phase Gate Reviews**: Major milestone checkpoints
- **Daily Standups**: Progress verification via ledger updates
- **Ad-hoc Reviews**: On-demand quality assessments
- **Final Integration**: Pre-merge comprehensive review

### 3. Escalation Triggers
- **Confidence Drop**: Below 99% confidence level
- **Timeline Risk**: Delays affecting critical path
- **Technical Blockers**: Issues requiring architectural decisions
- **Resource Conflicts**: Agent availability or capability issues
```

### Specialized Agent → Planning Agent
```markdown
## Progress Reporting Protocol

### 1. Task Status Updates
**Format**: Ledger JSON updates
**Frequency**: Real-time for status changes
**Content**:
- Task completion status
- Blockers or dependencies waiting
- Estimated completion time updates
- Quality metrics (test coverage, etc.)

### 2. Dependency Notifications
**Trigger**: Task completion that unblocks other agents
**Format**: Automated ledger cross-references
**Content**:
- Completed deliverable details
- Quality validation results
- Next phase readiness confirmation

### 3. Issue Escalation
**Trigger**: Blockers, conflicts, or confidence drops
**Target**: Control Agent (via Planning Agent)
**Content**:
- Issue description and impact
- Proposed solutions or alternatives
- Resource or timeline implications
```

### Agent-to-Agent Direct Communication
```markdown
## Peer Communication Protocol

### 1. Dependency Handoffs
**UX Agent → UI Agent**:
- Wireframes and interaction specifications
- Accessibility requirements
- Responsive design specifications
- User flow validation

**Backend Agent → UI Agent**:
- Store interface definitions
- API contract specifications
- Data validation schemas
- Error handling requirements

**UI Agent → Documentation Agent**:
- Component interfaces and props
- Usage examples and patterns
- Integration requirements
- Testing specifications

### 2. Quality Collaboration
**All Agents → Documentation Agent**:
- API changes requiring documentation
- New features needing user guides
- Architecture updates for technical docs

**All Agents → Version Control Agent**:
- Feature branch requirements
- Merge timing coordination
- Release preparation tasks
```

## Ledger Management Protocols

### Task Lifecycle Management
```json
{
  "taskLifecycle": {
    "states": ["pending", "assigned", "in_progress", "blocked", "review", "completed", "cancelled"],
    "transitions": {
      "pending → assigned": "Planning Agent distributes tasks",
      "assigned → in_progress": "Agent begins work",
      "in_progress → blocked": "Dependencies or issues arise",
      "blocked → in_progress": "Blockers resolved",
      "in_progress → review": "Work completed, awaiting validation",
      "review → completed": "Control Agent approves",
      "review → in_progress": "Revisions required",
      "* → cancelled": "Planning changes or priorities shift"
    }
  }
}
```

### Dependency Chain Management
```json
{
  "dependencyProtocol": {
    "validation": "Pre-execution dependency check",
    "notification": "Automatic alerts when dependencies complete",
    "blocking": "Clear blocking relationship documentation",
    "resolution": "Automated unblocking when dependencies satisfy"
  }
}
```

### Conflict Detection and Resolution
```json
{
  "conflictManagement": {
    "detection": {
      "fileConflicts": "Git merge conflict detection",
      "taskConflicts": "Overlapping task assignments",
      "resourceConflicts": "Agent availability conflicts",
      "dependencyConflicts": "Circular or impossible dependencies"
    },
    "resolution": {
      "immediate": "Pause conflicting work streams",
      "analysis": "Root cause identification",
      "planning": "Resolution strategy development",
      "validation": "Control Agent approval of resolution",
      "execution": "Coordinated conflict resolution"
    }
  }
}
```

## Communication Standards

### Message Formats
```markdown
## Standard Message Templates
