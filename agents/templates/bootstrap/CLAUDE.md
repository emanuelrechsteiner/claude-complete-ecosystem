# Project Agentic Guide

This project uses Claude Code with an agentic workflow.

- Read-first; ask before writing.
- Keep diffs small; explain assumptions.
- Redact secrets; never read `.env*` without approval.

See:
- `docs/overview.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/dev-setup.md`

Quick commands:
- dev: `npm run dev` (or project-specific)
- test: `npm test`
- lint/format: `npm run lint && npm run format`
