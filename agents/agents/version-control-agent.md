# Version Control Agent - Git Operations & Release Management Specialist

## Role & Responsibilities
The Version Control Agent manages all Git operations, branch strategies, commit management, and release coordination for the project.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Git Operations Management
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches, integration, and release management
- **Commit Management**: Conventional commits, meaningful messages, clean history
- **Merge Coordination**: Conflict resolution, integration testing, rollback procedures
- **Release Management**: Version tagging, release notes, deployment coordination

### 2. Code Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit Validation**: Ensure tests pass, linting compliance, TypeScript checks
- **Integration Testing**: Validate feature branches before merging
- **Rollback Procedures**: Quick recovery from problematic commits
- **History Maintenance**: Clean, readable commit history with proper attribution

### 3. Project-Specific Git Workflow

#### Branch Structure
```
main                    # Production-ready code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/venue-page      # Venue management implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/artist-page     # Artist management implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/profile-page    # Profile management implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/*               # Emergency fixes
```

#### Commit Convention
```
type(scope): description

feat(venues): add venue creation form with validation
fix(artists): resolve tour relationship loading issue
docs(readme): update setup instructions for new pages
test(venues): add comprehensive venue CRUD tests
refactor(stores): optimize venue store performance
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Branch Management Strategy

#### Feature Branch Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/venue-page
git push -u origin feature/venue-page

# Regular development commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(venues): implement venue list component"
git push origin feature/venue-page

# Merge back to main (after approval)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/venue-page
git push origin main
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Add venue management page"
```

#### Commit Frequency Strategy
- **After each component**: Individual component implementations
- **After tests**: When unit tests are added/updated
- **After integration**: When components are integrated with stores
- **After documentation**: When documentation is updated
- **Before requesting review**: Clean, tested, documented code

### 2. Pre-commit Quality Gates

#### Automated Checks
```bash
# Pre-commit hook script
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# TypeScript compilation
npm run build
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå TypeScript compilation failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Linting
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå ESLint checks failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Tests
npm run test:run
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Tests failed"
  exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ All pre-commit checks passed"
```

#### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] All new components have TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Unit tests written for new functionality
- [ ] Storybook stories created for UI components
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

### 3. Integration and Merge Strategy

#### Feature Integration Process
1. **Development Complete**: All agent tasks finished and validated
2. **Self-Testing**: Feature branch thoroughly tested in isolation
3. **Documentation Updated**: All relevant docs reflect changes
4. **Pre-merge Review**: Control Agent final approval
5. **Integration Testing**: Test with main branch
6. **Merge Execution**: Clean merge with proper commit message
7. **Post-merge Validation**: Verify no regressions introduced

#### Merge Commit Templates
```
Merge branch 'feature/venue-page' into main

* Complete venue management page implementation
* Add VenueList, VenueForm, VenueCard components  
* Implement venueManagementStore with CRUD operations
* Add comprehensive test coverage (95%+)
* Update documentation and Storybook stories
* Maintain performance benchmarks

### 4. Release Management

#### Version Numbering Strategy
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major feature additions
- **Minor (1.X.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (1.1.X)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements

#### Release Notes Template
```markdown

```

## Agent Coordination Protocol

### Regular Commit Schedule
- **Daily**: End-of-day commits for work in progress
- **Feature Complete**: When individual features are finished
- **Integration Points**: After successful agent collaboration
- **Documentation Updates**: Immediately after doc changes
- **Bug Fixes**: As soon as fixes are tested and validated

### Inter-Agent Synchronization
```bash
# Before starting work - sync with latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/current-work
git rebase main

# During development - regular updates
git add .
git commit -m "wip: venue form validation implementation"
git push origin feature/current-work

# Before requesting review - clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5  # Interactive rebase to clean history
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/current-work
```
