# Agent Coordination Framework

## Overview
This framework defines how multiple specialized agents collaborate under the Control Agent (Claude Code) to implement complex features while maintaining code quality and project consistency.

## Agent Hierarchy & Communication

### Control Agent (Claude Code)
**Role**: Orchestrator, Quality Gate, Decision Authority
- **Authority Level**: Final approval/denial for all agent actions
- **Responsibility**: Ensure >99% confidence in all implementations
- **Communication**: Direct interface with all agents

### Specialized Agents
**Reporting Structure**: All agents report to Control Agent before and after tasks
- **UX Agent**: User experience and workflow design
- **UI Agent**: React component implementation
- **Backend Agent**: Firebase and state management
- **Documentation Agent**: Technical documentation maintenance
- **Version Control Agent**: Git operations and release management

## Communication Protocol

### 1. Pre-Task Authorization
```markdown

**Agent**: [Agent Name]
**Task**: [Specific task description]
**Phase**: [Current project phase]
**Dependencies**: [Required inputs from other agents]

### Implementation Plan

- Fallback procedures if issues arise

**Request**: Permission to proceed with implementation
```

### 2. Control Agent Review Process
```markdown
## Control Agent Authorization Response

### Feedback
[Specific feedback, concerns, or required changes]

### Authorization
- [APPROVED]: Proceed with implementation as planned
- [DENIED]: Do not proceed, address concerns and resubmit
- [NEEDS_REVISION]: Modify plan and resubmit for approval

**Next Steps**: [Specific actions required before proceeding]
```

### 3. Post-Task Reporting
```markdown
## Agent Task Completion Report

**Agent**: [Agent Name]
**Task**: [Completed task]
**Status**: [COMPLETED/PARTIALLY_COMPLETED/FAILED]

### Deliverables
- [List of completed items]
- [Quality metrics achieved]
- [Tests passing/coverage achieved]
- [Documentation updated]

### Issues Encountered
- [Problems faced during implementation]
- [Solutions implemented]
- [Workarounds applied]
- [Technical debt incurred]

### Quality Validation
- All tests passing: ✅/❌
- Code review completed: ✅/❌
- Documentation updated: ✅/❌
- No regressions introduced: ✅/❌

### Integration Status
- Compatible with existing code: ✅/❌
- Ready for next phase: ✅/❌
- Rollback procedures tested: ✅/❌

**Request**: Permission to proceed to next task/phase
```

- Performance benchmarks met

### Phase 5: Documentation & Release
**Lead Agent**: Documentation Agent
**Supporting Agents**: Version Control Agent (release management)
**Control Agent Gates**:

## Quality Gates & Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **TypeScript Strict**: Zero type errors or warnings
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for new components and functions
- **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier compliance
- **Performance**: No regression in Core Web Vitals

### Architecture Compliance
- **Pattern Adherence**: Follow existing Zustand, Firebase, component patterns
- **Security Standards**: User-scoped data, proper validation, error handling
- **Scalability**: Efficient queries, proper indexing, optimization
- **Maintainability**: Clear code structure, comprehensive documentation

### Integration Standards
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality must remain intact
- **Backward Compatibility**: New features don't disrupt current workflows
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery mechanisms
- **User Experience**: Consistent with existing design patterns

## Agent Synchronization Schedule

### Daily Synchronization
- **Morning Standup**: Agent reports on planned tasks
- **Evening Report**: Progress updates and blockers
- **Issue Escalation**: Immediate notification of problems

### Phase Transition Gates
- **Phase Completion Review**: All agents report status
- **Quality Validation**: Control Agent verifies all standards met
- **Next Phase Authorization**: Permission granted to proceed

### Emergency Procedures
- **Critical Issue Protocol**: Immediate escalation to Control Agent
- **Rollback Procedures**: Coordinated rollback if major issues arise
- **Recovery Planning**: Collaborative problem resolution

## Inter-Agent Dependencies

### UX → UI Agent Flow
- **UX Deliverables**: Wireframes, user flows, interaction specs
- **UI Requirements**: Design implementation, accessibility compliance
- **Validation Loop**: UX review of UI implementation

### Backend → UI Agent Flow
- **Backend Deliverables**: Store interfaces, API specifications
- **UI Requirements**: Store integration, error handling, loading states
- **Integration Testing**: Joint validation of data flow

### Documentation ← All Agents Flow
