- **Evidence-based improvements** through pattern analysis

### Integration Requirements Specification

#### 1. Data Model Extensions

**Current Vector Models** need extension for agent observations:

```python
# EXTENSION: Agent Observation Chunk
class AgentObservationChunk(BaseModel):
    chunk_id: str                      # observation-[timestamp]-[agent]
    content: str                       # Natural language observation
    metadata: ObservationMetadata      # Extended metadata
    observation_type: str              # efficiency, error, sync, quality, etc.
    project_id: str                    # Project identifier
    session_id: str                    # Session identifier
    
class ObservationMetadata(ChunkMetadata):
    # Extends base ChunkMetadata with observation-specific fields
    agent_id: str                      # Observer agent
    target_agent: str                  # Observed agent
    observation_category: str          # efficiency, error, sync, quality
    severity: float                    # Impact score (0.0-1.0)
    evidence_strength: float           # Confidence in observation
    pattern_frequency: int             # How often pattern occurs
    improvement_potential: float       # Potential impact of fixing
    correlations: List[str]           # Related observations
    implementation_complexity: str     # easy, medium, hard
```

**Enhanced Search Capabilities**:

```python
class ObservationSearchQuery(SearchQuery):
    # Extends base SearchQuery for observation-specific searches
    agent_filter: Optional[str]        # Filter by specific agent
    pattern_type: Optional[str]        # Filter by pattern type
    severity_min: float = 0.0         # Minimum severity threshold
    project_context: Optional[str]     # Search within project context
    temporal_range: Optional[str]      # Time-based filtering
    correlation_depth: int = 1         # Include correlated observations
```
